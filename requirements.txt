# 🔹 Critical additions for your app (missing but used or highly recommended)
imghdr==0  # Built-in module, but pinning signals intent (no install needed, but good for docs)
# ↑ Use `imghdr` for secure image validation (see below)

# 🔹 For Grad-CAM (if you add explainability)
torchcam==0.5.2  # Lightweight, timm-compatible, no extra deps
# Alternative: captum (more powerful but heavier)

# 🔹 For Docker & production
gunicorn==23.0.0  # Needed if deploying Streamlit via reverse proxy (e.g., nginx)
# (Not required for local `streamlit run`, but essential for scalable cloud deployment)

# 🔹 Optional but highly recommended for safety
opencv-python-headless==4.10.0.84  # For robust image loading/validation (faster than PIL for large batches)

# 🔹 If you add calibration / metrics
scikit-learn==1.5.2  # You use sklearn.metrics in training — pin it!
